#### Q1: What are you planning to build?

Raise a cartoon cat, based on how much productivity you do. The more you procrastinate the less healthy the cat gets.

#### Q2: Who are your target users?

Anyone who wants to be productive with their computer. (i.e. Students, office workers)

#### Q3: Why would your users choose your product? What are they using today to solve their problem/need?

The product gets instant feedback in a "cute" way so the cat will feel an emotional drive to keep the cat healthy.
This would also attract people who love playing video games as it would "gamify" productivity.
Possible Expansion: has affection for each group member based on how much work they do.

### Highlights

- We went through different iterations of our original idea.
- For each idea, we identified potential problems and ideas which have already been implemented, which allowed us to eliminate majority of the ideas on our list.
- We finally decided to "gamify" our productivity idea that we had earlier and
think that it would be a fun project to do since most of us like playing games
and find it difficult to stay productive. So there would be a target audience for it.
