## Iteration 01 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: October 10th 10:30 - October 11th 1:10 am
 * Where: Online on Discord

## Process - Reflection

Very productive meeting, we have achieved our goal of deciding which idea is the best to pursue. This was done by having everyone rank every idea and then finding the average ranking. Because of this, we were able to narrow down to three ideas from which we chose the anti-procrastination tool idea.

#### Decisions that turned out well

Doing group ranking as it saved us time by not needing to discuss every idea.

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

Deciding on when to meet as many of us have conflicting schedules, so we ended up meeting very late.


#### Planned changes

 * Deciding on which technology to use (if python proves to be too difficult)
 * Assigning more concrete features by interviewing potential users
 * Creating a concrete time line for when code will be finished.


## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

 * Deciding on an idea to be submitted to the TA for review
 * Deciding on what language/frameworks we are using (python)

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

N/A

## Meeting Highlights

Next meeting we should
 * Allocate roles
 * Decide on specific implementation details.
 * Have a process monitoring system setup (maybe with Github Projects)
