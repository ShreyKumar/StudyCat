No specific roles and responsibilities assigned for this stage.

#### Events

Online meeting - Discussing potential ideas with team members.
Vote - Ranking vote to discuss and decide on the final idea for the project. Each member ranks the ideas they like from 1 to 6, then we take the most popular ranking as the final idea.


#### Artifacts

(No specific team organizational details as of now, since our main goal was to decide on which idea to implement to meet the deliverable deadline). In the future, we may potentially use Github Projects to organize our workflow.
