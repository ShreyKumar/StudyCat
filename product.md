#### Q1: What are you planning to build?

An extended version of the Coursography where students can plan their courses for any program they input.

#### Q2: Who are your target users?

University of Toronto students, we will extend it to other universities if there is popular demand.


#### Q3: Why would your users choose your product? What are they using today to solve their problem/need?

It allows users to plan out their course structure for every course instead of just Computer Science and Statistics. It saves a lot of time instead of scanning through each program and course to plan out your schedule.  It allows users to discover if the program will be doable for them before they apply to the program.
