## Iteration 02

 * Start date: October 23rd, 2017
 * End date: November 17th, 2017

## Process

#### Roles & responsibilities

Describe the different roles on the team and the responsibilities associated with each role.


First, we divided into three main teams:

Team 1 (Main Application): 

Kevin Kang

- Responsible for process monitoring
- Faciliate discussion in meetings


Darwin Truong

- Responsible for communication with the server


Kevin Zheng

- Responsible for overall UI appearance and integrating Kevin kang and Darwin Truong's tasks

Team 2 (Server): 

Hongyu Wang

- Responsible for implementing server endpoints for adding and removing data about a user
- Responsible for managing currently logged in users

Jeff Lin

- Responsible for adding endpoints to add and remove persistent data from firebase
- Also responible for checking database inserts

Team 3 (Extension): 

Shrey Kumar

- Responsible for coding the chrome extension

#### Events

Describe meetings (and other events) you are planning to have:

 * When and where? In-person or online?

 We are planning to have meetings online once per week on Sunday.

 * What's the purpose of each meeting?

    - You state the current progress you have on your portion of the code, if there are any problems with your portion.
    - Reassign and redistrubute new tasks that come up

 * Other events could be coding sessions, code reviews, quick weekly sync' meeting online, etc.
     - Coding sessions are to be done throughout the week by several individuals.

#### Artifacts

List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to organize your team.       

 * Artifacts can be To-do lists, Task boards, schedule(s), etc.
 * We want to understand:
   * How do you keep track of what needs to get done?
   * How do you prioritize tasks?
   * How do tasks get assigned to team members?

The main artifact we will produce is Taiga.io.

#### Git / GitHub workflow

Describe your Git / GitHub workflow.     
Essentially, we want to understand how your team members share a codebase and avoid conflicts.

 * Be concise, yet precise.      
For example, "we use pull-requests" is not a precise statement since it leaves too many open questions - Pull-requests from where to where? Who reviews the pull-requests? Who is responsible for merging them? etc.
 * If applicable, specify any naming conventions or standards you decide to adopt.
 * Don't forget to **explain why** you chose this workflow.

The main workflow we chose was to have group work on their own branch, and then after a task is completed, we will do a pull request from their own branch onto master. The reason why we did this was to make sure that each branch wouldn't conflict with other branches. It would also promote more freedom between each user 

## Product

#### Goals and tasks

 * Describe your goals for this iteration and the tasks that you will have to complete in order to achieve these goals.
 * Order the items from most to least important.
 * Feel free (but not obligated) to specify some/all tasks as user stories.

#### Artifacts

List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to present your project idea.

 * Artifacts can be text, code, images, videos, interactive mock-ups and/or any other useful artifact you can think of.
 * Make sure to explain the purpose of each artifact (i.e. Why is it on your to-do list? Why is it useful for your team?)
 * Be concise, yet precise.         
   For example: "Build the website" is not precise at all, but "Build a static home page and upload it somewhere, so that it is publicly accessible" is much clearer.
