Problem: University Students procrastinate a lot, and have bad tastes in cartoons

Lots of distractions both on the internet and on your computer (games, websites)

We made an app that combines the fun of procrastinating with the grind of a good days worth of hard work

Demo:
- Start at login screen
- Register user
- Setup programs (select EXEs and their category)
- Start application, begin monitoring and updating cat affection

- Also show off chrome extension, updating cat affection
